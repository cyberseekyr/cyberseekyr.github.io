Setup a funnel so that everyone knows where to go for help, guidance, and expertise.

Many organizations have not setup a one-stop shop leading to many questions, confusion, and often chaos on where to go for help. Word of mouth is usually the primary mechanism for getting assistance from cybersecurity professionals; all of which are overburdened and limited with resources. In this general environment (which is prevalent), there are challenges across people, process, and technology.

## Solution: Build a One-Stop Shop / Self-Service Portal - Open 24x7x365
After you build, your customers will know where to go to learn, ask questions, and ultimately engage. This reduces chaos and actually frees up resources from common questions; empowering customers to take action.
- Convert policies, procedures, and standards into searchable web pages (not pdf or word documents) to make them easier to consume
- Create focused content like checklists providing actionable information and grow a knowledge base over time (all you need is 3 pieces of useful content to start)
- Create an intake for customer questions, requests, or feedback
- Build additional capabilities or tools to empower customers
- Measure usage to demonstrate value
